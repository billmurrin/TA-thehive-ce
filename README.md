# TA-thehive
This add-on is designed to add alert action on Splunk to create alerts in [The Hive](https://thehive-project.org/)

# Installation
This app is designed to run on Splunk Search Head(s) on Linux plateforms
1. Download this [file](TA-thehive.tar.gz) which is the Splunk TA ( it is an archive containing the sub-directory TA-thehive)
2. Install the app on your Splunk Search Head(s): "Manage Apps" -> "Install app from file"
3. Restart Splunk (for later updates, you may skip this step)
4. At next logon, launch the app (Manage Apps > TA-thehive > launch app)
5. Configure proxy, logging level
6. Save TheHive Api key value under thehive_api_key1, thehive_api_key2 or thehive_api_key3 input fields
7. With lookup editor or other means, import the CSV table of TheHive instances [thehive_instance_list.csv.sample](thehive_instance_list.csv.sample) with the name being 'thehive_instance_list.csv' (IMPORTANT for script to work). Please note that you can upload another file provided the column names are the same.
8. Edit this lookup to point to your TheHive instance(s)
    - provide a name under column 'thehive_instance' - this is the name you are going to use in alert form
    - provide the url to your TH instance, ( /api/alert will be added to it to reach the endpoint)
    - indicate the name of the container containing the api key (defined in 6.): either thehive_api_key1 or thehive_api_keyÃ© or thehive_api_key3
    - check (or not) the certificate of the TheHive server: use only True or False
    - if applicable, provide the path to the certificate of thehive instance
    - use (or not) the proxy for this instance:: use only True or False
    - provide client certificate if required (and check the box to use it - use only True or False)
6. Parameters are saved under TA-thehive-ce/lookups/thehive_instance_list.csv
7. Important: Role(s)/user(s) using this app must have the capability to "list_storage_passwords" (as API KEYs and proxy password(s) are safely stored encrypted )
8. In addition, a CSV file is saved under **lookups/thehive_datatypes.csv**. It contains a mapping between field names and datatypes
	- standard datatypes are included at first alert if the file does not exist
	- then you can defined additional field (from datamodel) mapping to datatype e.g. on Splunk field _src_ (from datamodel Web) can be mapped to datatype _ip_, _dest_ to _domain_ etc. (in versions 1.x, filed name had to match datatypes)
9. This lookup can be edited to add custom datatypes in the same way.

# Use Cases

Here some activities you may carry out more easily with this app.
